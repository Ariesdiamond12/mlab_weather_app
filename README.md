# React + Vite  - Weather App

- I've created a weather app using React and Vite
- I used a weather API to fetch the current weather and 5-day forecast
- I implemented a simple UI using React components and styled components
- I've created a function that makes API calls to fetch the weather data
- I've added a weatherutils folder to that will display weather-related messages or push notifications based on the data received from the API
- Users are able to set their location and view the weather for that location
- Users are able to view the weather for multiple locations
- Users are able to view the weather for a specific location and view the 5-day forecast for that location
- Users are able to change the unit of measurement for the temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit)
- Users are able to customise the app's theme (day or night)
- Users are able to view the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
